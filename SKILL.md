# Document Intelligence

Entry point for all document processing tasks using Snowflake Cortex AI.

## Reference Files

This skill uses reference documentation for detailed function guidance:

| Reference | Location | Use For |
|-----------|----------|---------|
| AI_EXTRACT | `reference/ai-extract.md` | Function reference for structured extraction |
| AI_PARSE_DOCUMENT & AI_COMPLETE | `reference/ai-parse-doc-and-ai-complete.md` | Function reference for content parsing |
| **Extraction** | `reference/extraction.md` | Flow A: Structured field/table extraction workflow |
| **Parsing** | `reference/parsing.md` | Flow B: Full content parsing workflow |
| **Visual Analysis** | `reference/visual-analysis.md` | Flow C: Charts, blueprints, diagrams analysis |
| **Pipeline** | `reference/pipeline.md` | Post-processing: pipelines, storage |

**Load sub-skill based on user's extraction goal:**
- For structured fields/tables → Read `reference/extraction.md`
- For full text with layout or OCR → Read `reference/parsing.md`
- For charts, blueprints, diagrams → Read `reference/visual-analysis.md`
- After any flow completes → Read `reference/pipeline.md` for post-processing

## When to Use

- User wants to extract data from documents (PDFs, images, Office files)
- User mentions AI_EXTRACT or AI_PARSE_DOCUMENT
- User wants to process invoices, contracts, forms, reports
- User needs to analyze charts, blueprints, diagrams
- User wants to build document processing pipelines

```

### Step 1: Determine Extraction Goal (ASK FIRST)

**Ask** user what they want to extract. Provide both options AND allow free-form response:

```
What would you like to extract or analyze from your document?

Options:
1. Structured extraction - Extract specific fields, tables, or data points (e.g., invoice number, line items)
2. Full text parsing - Get complete document text, with or without layout preserved (OCR for scans)
3. Visual analysis - Analyze charts, graphs, diagrams, blueprints, or other visual content
4. Multiple types - Combine any of the above (e.g., extract fields AND analyze a chart)

Or describe what you need in your own words:
- "Extract invoice number, vendor name, and total amount"
- "Get all the text content with formatting preserved"
- "Analyze the charts and extract data points"
- "Pull out the table of line items"
- "Get a summary of the document"
- "Extract specific fields AND get the full text"

What do you need?
```

### Analyzing the Request

**Carefully analyze** the user's response to determine which flow(s) to trigger:

| User Mentions | Flow to Trigger | Function |
|---------------|-----------------|----------|
| Specific fields (names, dates, amounts, IDs) | **Flow A** | AI_EXTRACT |
| Tables with columns | **Flow A** | AI_EXTRACT |
| Full text, all content, complete document | **Flow B** | AI_PARSE_DOCUMENT |
| Layout, formatting, structure preserved | **Flow B** | AI_PARSE_DOCUMENT |
| OCR, scanned document, text recognition | **Flow B** | AI_PARSE_DOCUMENT |
| Charts, graphs, plots, trends | **Flow C** | AI_COMPLETE |
| Diagrams, blueprints, schematics | **Flow C** | AI_COMPLETE |
| Visual analysis, what's in the image | **Flow C** | AI_COMPLETE |

### Multiple Flows Detection

**Check if multiple flows are needed:**

| User Request Pattern | Flows Needed |
|---------------------|--------------|
| "Extract fields AND get full text" | Flow A + Flow B |
| "Get invoice data AND analyze the chart" | Flow A + Flow C |
| "Parse the document AND extract the diagram" | Flow B + Flow C |
| "Extract everything - fields, text, and charts" | Flow A + Flow B + Flow C |

**If multiple flows detected:**
```
I notice you need multiple types of extraction:
- [List detected needs]

I'll process these in sequence:
1. [First flow]
2. [Second flow]
...

Let's start with [first flow]. After that completes, I'll proceed to the next.
```

### Step 2: Get File Location

**Ask** user where their file is stored:

```
Where is your file located?
Options:
1. Snowflake stage (e.g., @my_db.my_schema.my_stage/file.pdf)
2. Local file on my computer
3. External stage (S3, Azure Blob, GCS)
4. Cloud storage (Google Drive, Dropbox, SharePoint, OneDrive, Box)
```

**If Snowflake stage:** Get the full stage path and proceed.

**If local file:** Help upload using PUT command:

```sql
-- Create a stage if needed
CREATE STAGE IF NOT EXISTS my_db.my_schema.doc_stage
  DIRECTORY = (ENABLE = TRUE)
  ENCRYPTION = (TYPE = 'SNOWFLAKE_SSE');

-- Upload file (run via SnowSQL, Snowflake CLI, or Python)
PUT file:///path/to/file.pdf @my_db.my_schema.doc_stage AUTO_COMPRESS=FALSE;

-- Verify upload
LIST @my_db.my_schema.doc_stage;
```

**If cloud storage:** Load the `openflow` skill to set up a connector, then return here.

### Step 3: Infer File Type from Extension

**Do NOT ask user about file type.** Infer from the file path extension:

```
File path: @stage/invoices/invoice_001.pdf
Extension: .pdf → PDF file (supported by all functions)
```

**Extension to Format Mapping:**

| Extension | Format | AI_EXTRACT | AI_PARSE_DOCUMENT | AI_COMPLETE |
|-----------|--------|------------|-------------------|-------------|
| .pdf | PDF | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ (convert to image) |
| .png, .jpg, .jpeg, .tiff, .bmp, .gif, .webp | Image | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| .docx | Word | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ |
| .pptx | PowerPoint | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ |
| .html, .htm | HTML | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ |
| .txt | Text | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ |
| .csv | CSV | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |
| .md | Markdown | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |
| .eml | Email | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |
| .xlsx, .xls | Excel | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| .doc, .ppt | Legacy Office | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |

**If unsupported format detected:**

For Excel (.xlsx, .xls):
```
Excel files are not supported by document AI functions.

Options:
1. Export as PDF and re-upload
2. Load directly into Snowflake (recommended for tabular data):

SELECT * FROM @stage/file.xlsx (FILE_FORMAT => 'TYPE=EXCEL');
```

For Legacy Office (.doc, .ppt):
```
Legacy Office formats require conversion.
Please save as .docx/.pptx or export as PDF.
```

### Step 4: Execute Flow(s)

Based on extraction goal from Step 1, load the appropriate sub-skill(s):

| Flow | Sub-Skill | When |
|------|-----------|------|
| Flow A | `reference/extraction.md` | Structured fields, tables |
| Flow B | `reference/parsing.md` | Full text, layout, OCR |
| Flow C | `reference/visual-analysis.md` | Charts, diagrams, blueprints |

**For multiple flows:** Execute sequentially, completing each before starting the next.

### Step 5: Post-Processing Options

After extraction/parsing/visual analysis is complete, **route to pipeline sub-skill**:

→ **Load `reference/pipeline.md`** to guide user through post-processing options:
- One-time extraction (done)
- Store results in Snowflake table
- Set up continuous processing pipeline

The pipeline sub-skill contains templates for all document processing patterns.

## Key Constraints

| Constraint | AI_EXTRACT | AI_PARSE_DOCUMENT |
|------------|------------|-------------------|
| Max file size | 100 MB | 50 MB |
| Max pages | 125 | 500 |
| Output format | JSON | Markdown |

## Stopping Points

- After Step 1 if file format is unsupported
- After Step 2 before routing to sub-skill
- After extraction completes for post-processing choice

## Output

Routes user to appropriate sub-skill with gathered context, then assists with post-processing.

## CRITICAL: Follow-Up Questions and New Extraction Requests

**ALWAYS re-evaluate the best flow when user asks a follow-up question or wants to extract something different.**

Do NOT assume the same flow applies. Each new request may require a different approach.

### When to Re-Evaluate

Re-evaluate the flow selection when user:
- Asks to extract different fields or data
- Wants to try a different approach
- Mentions a different document or file
- Asks follow-up questions about extraction
- Says "what about...", "can you also...", "now extract...", "try instead..."
- Expresses dissatisfaction with current results

### Re-Evaluation Process

**Ask** the user (or determine from context):

```
For this new request, let me determine the best approach.

What do you want to extract?

Options:
1. Structured extraction - Specific fields or tables (AI_EXTRACT)
2. Full text parsing - Complete text, with or without layout (AI_PARSE_DOCUMENT)
3. Visual analysis - Charts, blueprints, diagrams (AI_COMPLETE)
4. Multiple types - Combine approaches

Or describe what you need in your own words.
```

### Flow Selection Guide

| User Wants | Best Flow | Why |
|------------|-----------|-----|
| Named fields (invoice_number, date, vendor) | **Flow A: Extraction** | AI_EXTRACT returns structured JSON |
| Table data with known columns | **Flow A: Extraction** | AI_EXTRACT handles tables well |
| Full document text with structure | **Flow B: Parsing** | AI_PARSE_DOCUMENT preserves layout |
| OCR from scanned documents | **Flow B: Parsing** | AI_PARSE_DOCUMENT OCR mode |
| Chart/graph interpretation | **Flow C: Visual Analysis** | AI_COMPLETE vision understands images |
| Blueprint/diagram analysis | **Flow C: Visual Analysis** | AI_COMPLETE vision for complex visuals |
| Photo/screenshot analysis | **Flow C: Visual Analysis** | AI_COMPLETE vision for image content |

### Example Scenarios

**Scenario 1:** User extracted invoice fields (Flow A), now asks "can you also get the full text?"
→ Re-evaluate: Full text = **Flow B (Parsing)**, not Flow A

**Scenario 2:** User parsed document text (Flow B), now asks "extract just the table of line items"
→ Re-evaluate: Specific table = **Flow A (Extraction)**, not Flow B

**Scenario 3:** User extracted fields (Flow A), now asks "analyze the chart on page 3"
→ Re-evaluate: Chart analysis = **Flow C (Visual Analysis)**, not Flow A

**Scenario 4:** User analyzed a chart (Flow C), now asks "get all the data points as a table"
→ Stay on **Flow C** but use structured output prompt, OR switch to **Flow A** if chart is embedded in PDF

### Never Assume

❌ **Wrong:** "Since we used AI_EXTRACT before, let me continue with that..."
✅ **Right:** "For extracting the full text with layout, AI_PARSE_DOCUMENT (Flow B) is the better approach."

❌ **Wrong:** "I'll use the same approach for this new request..."
✅ **Right:** "Let me determine which flow is best for extracting chart data - that would be Visual Analysis (Flow C)."
